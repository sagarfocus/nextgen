/**
 * Site-wide constants: brand identity, contact information, and social URLs.
 *
 * Single source of truth — every component that needs the business email,
 * phone, address, or social profile should import from here. Do not hardcode
 * these values in JSX.
 *
 * `phone.display` uses an en-dash (U+2013) to match the typography shown
 * in the site footer. The `phone.tel` value is the same number stripped
 * to digits for the `tel:` URI scheme.
 *
 * Address fields are stored as plain text. Render sites that need a
 * non-breaking space (e.g. to keep "Circle N" or "TX 75038" together)
 * should apply U+00A0 at the JSX render layer, not in the data.
